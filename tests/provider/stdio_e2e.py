"""labelle-cli#446: the built tool's output, redirected to a FILE, is appended.

python tests/provider/stdio_e2e.py --tool zig-out/bin/labelle-ios[.exe]

Models `labelle doctor > out.txt 2>&1`: one open file that already holds a
"CLI" line is handed to the tool as BOTH stdout and stderr, then the "CLI"
appends another line. Every line must survive, whole and in order. A
positional writer in the tool (Zig 0.16's `File.writer`) pwrite()s from
offset 0 and overwrites the first line.

Python, not a Zig harness, on purpose: Python passes the file to the child
the way a shell redirect does on every OS (POSIX dup2; Windows
DuplicateHandle, so parent and child share ONE file object and its file
pointer). Zig 0.16's `std.process.spawn` with `.stdout = .{ .file = f }`
instead RE-OPENS the file on Windows (`OpenFile` relative to the handle, in
`Io/Threaded.zig` `processSpawnWindows`), which gives the child a fresh file
pointer at 0 and would fail even a correct, streaming tool.
